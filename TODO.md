## üó∫Ô∏è Project Roadmap

### Phase 1: Project Setup & Shopify Integration

1.  **Initialize Next.js Project:**
    - [x] Use `npx create-next-app@latest in-lieu-official` to bootstrap the application.
    - [x] Select TypeScript, ESLint, and Tailwind CSS.

2.  **Project Structure:**
    - [ ] Create a clean and scalable folder structure inspired by Next.js Commerce:
      ```
    /src
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ /app/                      # <-- Routing logic
    ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ /api
    ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ /cart
    ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ /products
    ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ /... (other routes)
    ‚îÇ
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ /components/               # <-- Reusable components
    ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ /cart
    ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ /layout
    ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ /product
    ‚îÇ
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ /lib/                      # <-- Core logic, utils, etc.
    ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ /shopify
    ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ /constants.ts
    ‚îÇ
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ /styles/                   # <-- Global styles
      ```

3.  **Shopify Setup & Environment Variables:**
    - [x] Create a new private app in the Shopify admin dashboard.
    - [x] Create an `.env.local` file and add the Shopify credentials, following the `next.js-commerce` convention:
      ```
      COMPANY_NAME="In Lieu"
      SITE_NAME="In Lieu"
      SHOPIFY_REVALIDATION_SECRET=
      SHOPIFY_STOREFRONT_ACCESS_TOKEN=
      SHOPIFY_STORE_DOMAIN=
      ```

4.  **Install Dependencies:**
    - [ ] Install any necessary UI/utility libraries (e.g., `framer-motion`, `react-slick`, `clsx`, `@headlessui/react`, `@heroicons/react`).

5.  **Shopify API Layer:**
    - [] Copy the entire `/src/lib/shopify/` from the Next.js Commerce template.


6.  **Shopify API Layer:**
    - **Goal:** Replicate the entire data-fetching and backend communication layer from the `learning-shopify-nextjs/commerce` project. This ensures the new application uses the same robust and battle-tested logic for interacting with the Shopify API.
    - **Tasks**
    - [x] Copy the entire `/src/lib/shopify` directory, which includes:
        - `index.ts`: The main entry point for the Shopify API library.
        - `fragments`: GraphQL fragments for reusable data structures (products, carts, etc.).
        - `mutations`: GraphQL mutations for creating and updating data (e.g., adding to cart).
        - `queries`: GraphQL queries for fetching data (e.g., getting products, collections).
        - `types.ts`
    - [x] Copy the cart management logic from `/src/components/cart`, including server actions and context providers.
        * **Note:** I've copied the entire folder for `/src/components/cart`. This includes the actual front end client components too (like add-to-cart.tsx and delete-item-button.tsx) 
        This is still useful to see how they call these server actions. We will replicate this logic in your own UI components (as another todo item)
    - [x] Copy the revalidation API route from `/src/app/api/revalidate`, which is crucial for on-demand revalidation when products are updated in Shopify.
    - [x] **What NOT to Copy (and to build custom):**
        - Any UI components from the reference project (e.g., `Navbar`, `ProductGrid`, `ProductPage`). These will be custom-built to match the unique design of the In Lieu brand. The goal is to use the reference project for its backend architecture, not its frontend presentation.


## Phase 2: Core Component & Page Development


1.  **Layout & Navbar (New "Makurro" Floating Design)**
    - **Objective:** Build a responsive, modern, floating pill-shaped navigation bar based on the reference design. The initial focus will be on the mobile view.

    - [x] **Step 1: Scaffolding & Setup**
        - [x] Create the new component file structure:
            ```
            /src/components/layout/navbar/
            ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Navbar.tsx         # Parent container ('use client')
            ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ NavLinks.tsx       # Navigation links (Server Component)
            ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ CartButton.tsx     # Cart icon button ('use client')
            ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ MenuButton.tsx     # Menu icon button ('use client')
            ```
        - [x] Install any necessary dependencies for icons (e.g., `@heroicons/react`).

    - [x] **Step 2: `NavLinks.tsx` (Server Component)**
        - [x] Implement as a client Component.
        - [x] Accept navigation links via props (e.g., `[{ name: 'shop', href: '#shop' }]`).
        - [x] Render links: "makurro", "lookbook", "about", "shop".
        - [x] Style with Flexbox (`flex gap-x-5`).
        - [x] Implement logic/styling for the active link (underlined).

    - [x] **Step 3: `Navbar.tsx` (Parent Client Component)**
        - [x] Implement as a Client Component (`'use client'`).
        - [x] Create and manage state: `isCartOpen`, `isMenuOpen`.
        - [x] Define handler functions: `toggleCart`, `toggleMenu`.
        - [x] Assemble the layout:
            - Main "floating pill" container (`bg-white`, `rounded-full`, `shadow-lg`, etc.).
            - Use Flexbox to position `NavLinks` on the left and buttons on the right.
            - Add the vertical separator (`<div className="w-px h-6 bg-gray-200">`).
            - Ensure the navbar is horizontally centered on the page.

    - [x] **Step 4: Button Components (`CartButton.tsx` & `MenuButton.tsx`)**
        - [x] Implement `CartButton.tsx` as a Client Component.
        - [x] Pass `toggleCart` function to it as a prop and call it `onClick`.
        - [x] Style `CartButton` with a background color and specific rounding:
            - Left side: fully rounded (`rounded-l-full`).
            - Right side: 8pt radius (`rounded-r-lg`).
        - [x] Implement `MenuButton.tsx` similarly, passing `toggleMenu` as a prop.
        - [x] Style `MenuButton` with specific rounding:
            - Right side: fully rounded (`rounded-r-full`).
            - Left side: 8pt radius (`rounded-l-lg`).
        - [x] Ensure styling (background, hover states) is consistent between both buttons.

    - [ ] **Step 5: Cart Data Integration**
        - [ ] In `CartButton.tsx`, perform the GraphQL query to fetch the number of items in the cart.
        - [ ] Implement a badge to display the item count.
        - [ ] The badge should be positioned on the corner of the icon and only visible if the count > 0.

    - [ ] **Step 6: Final Integration**
        - [ ] Create placeholder modals for the cart and menu.
        - [ ] Conditionally render these modals in `Navbar.tsx` based on the `isCartOpen` and `isMenuOpen` states.
        - [ ] Add the final `Navbar` component to the root layout (`/src/app/layout.tsx`).


2.  **Cart Management:**
    - [ ] Implement a `CartProvider` using React Context (`/src/components/cart/cart-context.tsx`) to manage the cart state throughout the application.
    - [ ] Use React's `useOptimistic` hook for a better user experience when adding, updating, or removing items from the cart.
    - [ ] Create server actions in `/src/components/cart/actions.ts` to handle all cart operations (add, remove, update).

3.  **Dynamic Product Page:**
    - [ ] Create a dynamic route: `/src/app/product/[handle]/page.tsx`.
    - [ ] Fetch product data from Shopify using the `getProduct` function from the Shopify API library.
    - [ ] Implement the product gallery (`/src/components/product/gallery.tsx`).
    - [ ] Create the `VariantSelector` component (`/src/components/product/variant-selector.tsx`) to handle product options.
    - [ ] Use a `ProductProvider` and `useProduct` hook to manage the selected variant state.
    - [ ] Implement the `AddToCart` button, which will call the `addItem` server action.

4.  **Static Pages:**
    - [ ] Recreate the **Lookbook**, **About**, and **Delivery & Returns** pages as static pages within the `/app` directory.

5.  **Homepage (Departure Board):**
    - [ ] Recreate the unique split-flap departure board UI.
    - [ ] To fetch recent orders, we will need to use the Shopify Admin API, as the Storefront API does not expose order data. This will require a separate, secure API route that is *not* exposed to the client.
    - [ ] Create an API route (e.g., `/app/api/orders/route.ts`) that uses the Shopify Admin API to fetch recent orders. This route must be protected.
    - [ ] Connect the homepage component to this API route to display the order data.

## Phase 3: Styling & Finalization

1.  **Styling:**
    - [ ] Use Tailwind CSS for all styling.
    - [ ] Define global styles and import fonts in `/src/app/globals.css`.
    - [ ] Ensure all components are fully responsive.

2.  **Code Quality & Conventions:**
    - [ ] Use ESLint and Prettier to maintain a consistent code style.
    - [ ] Follow the architectural patterns from the `next.js-commerce` reference project.

3.  **Deployment & Revalidation:**
    - [ ] Configure the project for deployment on Vercel.
    - [ ] Add the environment variables to the Vercel project settings.
    - [ ] Set up a webhook in Shopify to call the `/api/revalidate` endpoint when products or collections are updated. This will use the `SHOPIFY_REVALIDATION_SECRET` to secure the endpoint.

## Phase 4: Post-Launch Tasks

- [ ] Set up analytics.
- [ ] Perform SEO optimizations.
- [ ] Final testing across multiple devices and browsers.
