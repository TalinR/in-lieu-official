## üó∫Ô∏è Project Roadmap

### Phase 1: Project Setup & Shopify Integration

1.  **Initialize Next.js Project:**
    - [x] Use `npx create-next-app@latest in-lieu-official` to bootstrap the application.
    - [x] Select TypeScript, ESLint, and Tailwind CSS.

2.  **Project Structure:**
    - [ ] Create a clean and scalable folder structure inspired by Next.js Commerce:
      ```
    /src
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ /app/                      # <-- Routing logic
    ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ /api
    ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ /cart
    ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ /products
    ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ /... (other routes)
    ‚îÇ
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ /components/               # <-- Reusable components
    ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ /cart
    ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ /layout
    ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ /product
    ‚îÇ
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ /lib/                      # <-- Core logic, utils, etc.
    ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ /shopify
    ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ /constants.ts
    ‚îÇ
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ /styles/                   # <-- Global styles
      ```

3.  **Shopify Setup & Environment Variables:**
    - [x] Create a new private app in the Shopify admin dashboard.
    - [x] Create an `.env.local` file and add the Shopify credentials, following the `next.js-commerce` convention:
      ```
      COMPANY_NAME="In Lieu"
      SITE_NAME="In Lieu"
      SHOPIFY_REVALIDATION_SECRET=
      SHOPIFY_STOREFRONT_ACCESS_TOKEN=
      SHOPIFY_STORE_DOMAIN=
      ```

4.  **Install Dependencies:**
    - [ ] Install any necessary UI/utility libraries (e.g., `framer-motion`, `react-slick`, `clsx`, `@headlessui/react`, `@heroicons/react`).

5.  **Shopify API Layer:**
    - [] Copy the entire `/src/lib/shopify/` from the Next.js Commerce template.


6.  **Shopify API Layer:**
    - **Goal:** Replicate the entire data-fetching and backend communication layer from the `learning-shopify-nextjs/commerce` project. This ensures the new application uses the same robust and battle-tested logic for interacting with the Shopify API.
    - **Tasks**
    - [x] Copy the entire `/src/lib/shopify` directory, which includes:
        - `index.ts`: The main entry point for the Shopify API library.
        - `fragments`: GraphQL fragments for reusable data structures (products, carts, etc.).
        - `mutations`: GraphQL mutations for creating and updating data (e.g., adding to cart).
        - `queries`: GraphQL queries for fetching data (e.g., getting products, collections).
        - `types.ts`
    - [x] Copy the cart management logic from `/src/components/cart`, including server actions and context providers.
        * **Note:** I've copied the entire folder for `/src/components/cart`. This includes the actual front end client components too (like add-to-cart.tsx and delete-item-button.tsx) 
        This is still useful to see how they call these server actions. We will replicate this logic in your own UI components (as another todo item)
    - [x] Copy the revalidation API route from `/src/app/api/revalidate`, which is crucial for on-demand revalidation when products are updated in Shopify.
    - [x] **What NOT to Copy (and to build custom):**
        - Any UI components from the reference project (e.g., `Navbar`, `ProductGrid`, `ProductPage`). These will be custom-built to match the unique design of the In Lieu brand. The goal is to use the reference project for its backend architecture, not its frontend presentation.


## Phase 2: Core Component & Page Development


1.  **Layout & Navbar (New "Makurro" Floating Design)**
    - **Objective:** Build a responsive, modern, floating pill-shaped navigation bar based on the reference design. The initial focus will be on the mobile view.

    - [x] **Step 1: Scaffolding & Setup**
        - [x] Create the new component file structure:
            ```
            /src/components/layout/navbar/
            ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Navbar.tsx         # Parent container ('use client')
            ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ NavLinks.tsx       # Navigation links (Server Component)
            ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ CartButton.tsx     # Cart icon button ('use client')
            ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ MenuButton.tsx     # Menu icon button ('use client')
            ```
        - [x] Install any necessary dependencies for icons (e.g., `@heroicons/react`).

    - [x] **Step 2: `NavLinks.tsx` (Server Component)**
        - [x] Implement as a client Component.
        - [x] Accept navigation links via props (e.g., `[{ name: 'shop', href: '#shop' }]`).
        - [x] Render links: "makurro", "lookbook", "about", "shop".
        - [x] Style with Flexbox (`flex gap-x-5`).
        - [x] Implement logic/styling for the active link (underlined).

    - [x] **Step 3: `Navbar.tsx` (Parent Client Component)**
        - [x] Implement as a Client Component (`'use client'`).
        - [x] Create and manage state: `isCartOpen`, `isMenuOpen`.
        - [x] Define handler functions: `toggleCart`, `toggleMenu`.
        - [x] Assemble the layout:
            - Main "floating pill" container (`bg-white`, `rounded-full`, `shadow-lg`, etc.).
            - Use Flexbox to position `NavLinks` on the left and buttons on the right.
            - Add the vertical separator (`<div className="w-px h-6 bg-gray-200">`).
            - Ensure the navbar is horizontally centered on the page.

    - [x] **Step 4: Button Components (`CartButton.tsx` & `MenuButton.tsx`)**
        - [x] Implement `CartButton.tsx` as a Client Component.
        - [x] Pass `toggleCart` function to it as a prop and call it `onClick`.
        - [x] Style `CartButton` with a background color and specific rounding:
            - Left side: fully rounded (`rounded-l-full`).
            - Right side: 8pt radius (`rounded-r-lg`).
        - [x] Implement `MenuButton.tsx` similarly, passing `toggleMenu` as a prop.
        - [x] Style `MenuButton` with specific rounding:
            - Right side: fully rounded (`rounded-r-full`).
            - Left side: 8pt radius (`rounded-l-lg`).
        - [x] Ensure styling (background, hover states) is consistent between both buttons.

    - [ ] **Step 5: Cart Data Integration**
        - [ ] In `CartButton.tsx`, perform the GraphQL query to fetch the number of items in the cart.
        - [ ] Implement a badge to display the item count.
        - [ ] The badge should be positioned on the corner of the icon and only visible if the count > 0.

    - [ ] **Step 6: Final Integration**
        - [ ] Create placeholder modals for the cart and menu.
        - [ ] Conditionally render these modals in `Navbar.tsx` based on the `isCartOpen` and `isMenuOpen` states.
        - [ ] Add the final `Navbar` component to the root layout (`/src/app/layout.tsx`).


2.  **Cart Management:**
    - [ ] Implement a `CartProvider` using React Context (`/src/components/cart/cart-context.tsx`) to manage the cart state throughout the application.
    - [ ] Use React's `useOptimistic` hook for a better user experience when adding, updating, or removing items from the cart.
    - [ ] Create server actions in `/src/components/cart/actions.ts` to handle all cart operations (add, remove, update).

3.  **Dynamic Product Page:**
    - [ ] Create a dynamic route: `/src/app/product/[handle]/page.tsx`.
    - [ ] Fetch product data from Shopify using the `getProduct` function from the Shopify API library.
    - [ ] Implement the product gallery (`/src/components/product/gallery.tsx`).
    - [ ] Create the `VariantSelector` component (`/src/components/product/variant-selector.tsx`) to handle product options.
    - [ ] Use a `ProductProvider` and `useProduct` hook to manage the selected variant state.
    - [ ] Implement the `AddToCart` button, which will call the `addItem` server action.

4.  **Static Pages:**
    - [ ] Recreate the **Lookbook**, **About**, and **Delivery & Returns** pages as static pages within the `/app` directory.

5.  **Homepage (Departure Board):**
    - [ ] Recreate the unique split-flap departure board UI.
    - [ ] To fetch recent orders, we will need to use the Shopify Admin API, as the Storefront API does not expose order data. This will require a separate, secure API route that is *not* exposed to the client.
    - [ ] Create an API route (e.g., `/app/api/orders/route.ts`) that uses the Shopify Admin API to fetch recent orders. This route must be protected.
    - [ ] Connect the homepage component to this API route to display the order data.

6.  **Menu Modal**
    - **Objective:** Build a responsive pop-out menu modal with image, product tags, page navigation, social media icons, and brand logo. The layout adapts from mobile (stacked) to desktop (side-by-side).

    - [x] **Step 1: MenuImage.tsx Component**
        - [x] Create `/src/components/layout/menu/MenuImage.tsx` as a client component.
        - [x] Integrate the existing `ResponsiveSafeImage.tsx` component for image display.
        - [ ] Accept props: `imageSrc`, `imageAlt`, and `productTags` array.
        - [ ] Implement container with relative positioning to support absolute-positioned product tags.
        - [x] Mobile styling: Use `flex-1` to fill remaining vertical space in flex column layout.
        - [x] Desktop styling: Use `lg:w-1/2` or `lg:w-3/5` for fixed width, `h-screen` for full height.
        - [x] Render `ProductTag` components with absolute positioning based on tag coordinates.

    - [ ] **Step 2: ProductTag.tsx Component**
        - [ ] Create `/src/components/layout/menu/ProductTag.tsx` as a client component.
        - [ ] Accept props: `productName`, `productHandle`, `position` (x, y coordinates), `onClick` handler.
        - [ ] Implement clickable tag with clean styling (pill-shaped, subtle background).
        - [ ] Position absolutely within the image container using `position.x` and `position.y`.
        - [ ] Add hover states and smooth transitions.
        - [ ] Handle click events to navigate to product pages (`/product/[handle]`).
        - [ ] Ensure tags are responsive and scale appropriately on different screen sizes.

    - [x] **Step 3: PageLinks.tsx Component**
        - [x] Create `/src/components/layout/menu/PageLinks.tsx` as a server component.
        - [x] Accept props: `pages` array with `{ name: string, description: string, href: string }` structure.
        - [x] Accept prop: `currentPath` string to determine which page is currently active.
        - [x] Render navigation links for main site pages ("collection", "delivery and returns").
        - [x] **Each page link structure:**
            - [x] Title: Clean typography (`text-lg`, `font-medium` or similar).
            - [x] Description: Smaller, lighter text below the title (`text-sm`, `text-gray-600` or similar).
        - [x] **Dynamic styling based on current page:**
            - [x] Active page: Different text color, font weight, or highlighting.
            - [x] Inactive pages: Default styling with hover states (`hover:opacity-75`).
        - [x] Use Next.js `Link` component for client-side navigation.
        - [x] Add proper spacing between link groups (`space-y-4` or similar).
        - [x] Ensure responsive behavior and proper touch targets on mobile.

    - [x] **Step 4: Social Media & Logo Section**
        - [x] Create `/src/components/layout/menu/SocialSection.tsx` as a server component.
        - [x] **Mobile Layout (Vertical Stack):**
            - [x] Container: Use Flexbox (`flex flex-col items-center space-y-4`).
            - [x] **Social Icons (Top Section):**
                - [x] Create Instagram and TikTok SVG icons or use icon library.
                - [x] Container for icons: `flex space-x-4` to place them side by side.
                - [x] Wrap in `<a>` tags with proper `href` attributes.
                - [x] Consistent sizing (`w-6`, `h-6`) and center alignment.
                - [x] Add hover states and accessibility attributes.
            - [x] **Brand Logo (Bottom Section):**
                - [x] Create or import "in lieu" SVG logo.
                - [x] Center-aligned below the social icons.
                - [x] Make logo clickable to navigate to homepage.
        - [x] **Desktop Layout (Horizontal):**
            - [x] Container: Use Flexbox (`lg:flex-row lg:justify-between lg:items-center`).
            - [x] **Social Icons (Left Side):**
                - [x] Instagram and TikTok icons side by side (`flex space-x-4`).
                - [x] Aligned to the left of the container.
            - [x] **Brand Logo (Right Side):**
                - [x] Aligned to the right of the container.
                - [x] Maintains proper alignment with social icons.
        - [x] **Responsive Behavior:**
            - [x] Seamless transition between mobile (vertical) and desktop (horizontal) layouts.
            - [x] Ensure proper spacing and alignment at all breakpoints.
            - [x] Test touch interactions on mobile and hover states on desktop.

    - [ ] **Step 5: Enhanced MenuModal.tsx Integration**
        - [ ] Update existing `MenuModal.tsx` to implement the new layout structure.
        - [ ] **Main Container:**
            - [ ] Fixed positioning: `fixed inset-0 z-40`.
            - [ ] Background: `bg-white` or appropriate brand color.
            - [ ] Responsive layout: `flex flex-col lg:flex-row`.
            - [ ] Overall padding: `p-4` or `p-6`.
        - [ ] **Mobile Layout (Column):**
            - [ ] Image section: `flex-1` to fill remaining space.
            - [ ] Bottom content section: `h-auto` with proper spacing.
            - [ ] Vertical arrangement of PageLinks, SocialSection.
        - [ ] **Desktop Layout (Row):**
            - [ ] Image section: `lg:w-1/2` or `lg:w-3/5`, `h-screen`.
            - [ ] Content section: `lg:w-1/2` or `lg:w-2/5`, `h-screen`.
            - [ ] Content vertical arrangement: `flex flex-col justify-between` or `justify-center`.

    - [ ] **Step 6: Data Integration & Props**
        - [ ] Define TypeScript interfaces for all component props.
        - [ ] Create mock data structure for product tags with coordinates.
        - [ ] Implement data fetching for featured products (if needed).
        - [ ] Pass navigation pages data to PageLinks component.
        - [ ] Configure social media URLs and brand logo source.

    - [ ] **Step 7: Responsive Behavior & Breakpoints**
        - [ ] Test mobile view (iPhone 16 Pro reference).
        - [ ] Test desktop view (Frame 87 reference).
        - [ ] Implement smooth transitions between breakpoints.
        - [ ] Ensure proper touch interactions on mobile.
        - [ ] Verify image scaling and product tag positioning across devices.

    - [ ] **Step 8: Integration with Existing Components**
        - [ ] Ensure `SectionLinks.tsx` renders correctly in bottom-left (mobile) or appropriate position (desktop).
        - [ ] Verify `Navbar.tsx` integration and z-index layering.
        - [ ] Test modal open/close animations and body scroll locking.
        - [ ] Implement proper focus management for accessibility.

    - [ ] **Step 9: Final Polish & Testing**
        - [ ] Add loading states for image and product data.
        - [ ] Implement error handling for failed image loads.
        - [ ] Test keyboard navigation and screen reader compatibility.
        - [ ] Optimize performance (lazy loading, image optimization).
        - [ ] Cross-browser testing and mobile device testing.

7.  **SectionLinks Update**
    - **Objective:** Transform SectionLinks into a global component that appears on every page (including when menu modal is open), with dynamic sections based on the current page and smooth animations when transitioning between pages.

    - [x] **Step 1: Integrate SectionLinks into Navbar Component**
        - [x] Move SectionLinks logic from individual pages into the Navbar component
        - [x] Update Navbar.tsx to include SectionLinks as a child component
        - [x] Adjust z-index to ensure SectionLinks appears above MenuModal (set to `z-[70]`)
        - [x] Remove SectionLinks from individual pages (starting with `/src/app/page.tsx`)
        - [x] Test that SectionLinks appears on all pages through the global navbar

    - [x] **Step 2: Create Sections Context Provider**
        - [x] Create `/src/components/layout/SectionsContext.tsx` with:
            - Context for managing current page sections
            - Provider component that wraps the app
            - Hook `useSections()` for consuming sections
            - Method `setSections(sections: Section[])` for updating sections
        - [x] Add SectionsProvider to the root layout (`/src/app/layout.tsx`)
        - [x] Define TypeScript interfaces for Section and SectionsContext

    - [x] **Step 3: Make SectionLinks Context-Aware**
        - [x] Update SectionLinks component to consume sections from context instead of props
        - [x] Add state management for tracking section changes
        - [x] Implement detection when sections array changes (page navigation)
        - [x] Add loading state while sections are being updated

    - [ ] **Step 4: Implement Page-to-Page Transition Animations**
        - [ ] **Exit Animation (Current sections sliding out):**
            - [ ] Animate current section links sliding to the left and fading out
            - [ ] Animate vertical indicator shrinking and moving off-screen
            - [ ] Duration: ~300ms with easing function
        - [ ] **Enter Animation (New sections sliding in):**
            - [ ] New section links slide in from the left with fade-in effect
            - [ ] Vertical indicator animates to new position and grows to fit first section
            - [ ] Duration: ~300ms with easing function, delayed by ~150ms after exit
        - [ ] Use Framer Motion or CSS transitions for smooth animations
        - [ ] Ensure animations don't interfere with scroll-based indicator movement

    - [ ] **Step 5: Update Individual Pages to Use Context**
        - [x] **Homepage (`/src/app/page.tsx`):**
            - [x] Add `useEffect` to call `setSections()` with homepage sections on mount
            - [x] Remove direct SectionLinks component usage
            - [x] Sections: `[{ id: 'makurro', name: 'makurro' }, { id: 'lookbook', name: 'lookbook' }, { id: 'about', name: 'about' }, { id: 'shop', name: 'shop' }]`
        - [ ] **Other Pages (when created):**
            - [ ] Delivery page: Set appropriate sections for that page's content
            - [ ] Product pages: Set sections relevant to product content
            - [ ] About page: Set sections for about page content

    - [ ] **Step 6: Handle Edge Cases & States**
        - [ ] **No Sections State:** Hide SectionLinks component when no sections are set
        - [ ] **Single Section:** Handle case where only one section exists (no indicator animation)
        - [ ] **Menu Modal Open:** Ensure SectionLinks remains visible and functional when menu is open
        - [ ] **Page Load:** Handle initial page load with proper section initialization
        - [ ] **Navigation Interruption:** Handle rapid page changes during animations

    - [ ] **Step 7: Styling & Visual Polish**
        - [ ] Ensure consistent positioning across all pages (`fixed bottom-6 left-8`)
        - [ ] Maintain `mix-blend-difference` styling for visibility over varied backgrounds
        - [ ] Add smooth hover states that work with the new animation system
        - [ ] Test contrast and readability across different page backgrounds
        - [ ] Ensure animations are performant and don't cause layout shifts

    - [ ] **Step 8: Testing & Refinement**
        - [ ] Test SectionLinks functionality on all existing pages
        - [ ] Verify smooth animations during page transitions
        - [ ] Test scroll behavior and indicator tracking on different screen sizes
        - [ ] Ensure proper interaction with MenuModal (visibility and z-index)
        - [ ] Test accessibility with keyboard navigation and screen readers
        - [ ] Performance testing for animation smoothness

    - [ ] **Step 9: Documentation & Cleanup**
        - [ ] Update component documentation with new usage patterns
        - [ ] Create examples of how pages should implement section setting
        - [ ] Remove old SectionLinks usage patterns from codebase
        - [ ] Add TypeScript types for better developer experience

## Phase 3: Styling & Finalization

1.  **Styling:**
    - [ ] Use Tailwind CSS for all styling.
    - [ ] Define global styles and import fonts in `/src/app/globals.css`.
    - [ ] Ensure all components are fully responsive.

2.  **Code Quality & Conventions:**
    - [ ] Use ESLint and Prettier to maintain a consistent code style.
    - [ ] Follow the architectural patterns from the `next.js-commerce` reference project.

3.  **Deployment & Revalidation:**
    - [ ] Configure the project for deployment on Vercel.
    - [ ] Add the environment variables to the Vercel project settings.
    - [ ] Set up a webhook in Shopify to call the `/api/revalidate` endpoint when products or collections are updated. This will use the `SHOPIFY_REVALIDATION_SECRET` to secure the endpoint.

## Phase 4: Post-Launch Tasks

- [ ] Set up analytics.
- [ ] Perform SEO optimizations.
- [ ] Final testing across multiple devices and browsers.
